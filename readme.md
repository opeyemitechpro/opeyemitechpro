I am an AWS Certified Solutions Architect with competence, confidence, and credibility with practical cloud skills in AWS Cloud technology, across a wide range of AWS services. Using architectural design principles, I have the ability to strategically design well-architected distributed systems that are scalable, resilient, efficient, and fault-tolerant.

I have extensive experience in Microsoft technologies, servers, PCs, and other technology solutions from leading hardware and software vendors; I'm a Microsoft-certified Professional and have successfully implemented Microsoft and other business solutions for medium to large-scale organizations. 

With over 15 years of industry experience and a sound technical foundation in IT, I combine skills such as cloud virtualization, web server management, systems administration, network administration, database administration, and project management to be a well-rounded and experienced IT Professional. 

When not working on IT projects, I love to explore my passion for learning by researching new and emerging trends as I trie out various web & cloud-based services and products while rapidly learning new approaches to achieving great things. 

I also love to teach, mentor, or provide guidance to others; a task that requires patience and people management skills. I need no supervision having been a self-starter entrepreneur and team leader that earned the trust and confidence of clients for many years.
